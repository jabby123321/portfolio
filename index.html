                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p> Hi! I'm Joseph Stevens, a second-year cybersecurity undergrad student from York. </p>
                <p> I have always been an inquisitive mind. From the time I first used the family computer, technology
                    has fascinated me, from playing games on my sister's DS Lite to getting a Raspberry Pi B+ on my 11th
                    birthday.I have developed from a young tinkerer to a keen student, developing deep interests
                    in network security and embedded systems. </p>
                <p> I have a strong sense of community, being a scout from the age of 6 and actively a part of the
                    movement today. For me, being a cybersecurity professional is an extension of this. Being part of a
                    community of professionals all working to keep the technology in the wider community secure is a
                    great motivator. </p>

                <h2>BSc Cybersecurity</h2>
                <p> I am studying my BSc in cybersecurity at York St John University.<br>
                    The course covers: Programming, Maths, Problem Solving, Security Systems and Products, Programming
                    for the Web, Operating Systems, Software Engineering, Systems Programming, Database Systems,
                    Computer Networks, Digital Forensics, Information Security and Risk Management, as well as four
                    optional modules which I am yet to choose and a dissertation which I have not yet selected a subject
                    for </p>
                <h2>Extended Diploma in Computing (Level 3)</h2>
                <p> I have an Extended Diploma in computing (equivalent to 3 A-levels) from York College. This two-year
                    course covered a range of modules in different areas of computing, from Human-Computer Interfaces,
                    Project Management and Cyber Security. </p>

                <h1>Professional Background</h1>
                <h2>McDonald's Shift Manager</h2>
                <p> I was hired as a McDonald's crew member while studying at college in the winter of 2022. While
                    working as a crew member, I learnt a lot about how to work as part of a team and meet customer
                    expectations. Shortly after, in the summer of 2023, I took a promotion to be a crew trainer, taking
                    on a higher level of responsibility in my workplace and taking an opportunity to help new staff out.
                    In the following spring, I was once again promoted to shift manager, where I learnt many
                    valuable interpersonal skills, organisational skills, teamwork and leadership skills. </p>

                <h1>Away from the Screen</h1>
                <h2>Scouts</h2>
                <p> I have been a Scout all of my life. Joining the movement as a Beaver at the age of six, scouting
                    seriously enriched my childhood. The opportunities scouting gave me were vast, from weekends at
                    the local scout camp to learning skills and about the world; it even took me to America for the
                    24<sup>th</sup> World Scout Jamboree. These opportunities were second only to the community which
                    Scouting gave me. I was given mentorship, a diverse international community, and a set of core
                    values which I will hold onto for the rest of my life. </p>
                <p> When I became 14, I was offered a role in my Scout Group as a Young Leader, which began my
                    volunteering journey. This has given me a chance to provide for the young people in my community
                    the same opportunities I was able to access as a kid. And has given me the scope to continue pushing
                    for the diversity and inclusion on which Scouting is built, and which it prides itself on. </p>
                <p> I think the Scouting values I have taken with me can be succinctly expressed by a simple quote from
                    Lord Robert Baden-Powell (Founder of Scouting): "Leave this world a little better than you found
                    it".
                </p>

                <h2>Climbing</h2>
                <p> I am a keen climber. Starting bouldering at my local climbing gym when I was 15, I took to it like a
                    fish to water. Since then, I have been a committed boulderer, as well as taking up other disciplines
                    more casually, learning to lead and top rope climb a year or two later. When I joined university, I
                    was keen to join the mountaineering society, and have since thoroughly embraced all aspects of this
                    society, joining in socially, in training sessions, casual climbing sessions, and have been selected
                    for and been a committed member of the team in both years that I have been studying at uni. Going
                    forward, I would like to work towards welcoming new climbers to the sport, intending to join the
                    committee to help the society help more people as I continue my studies. </p>

                <h2>Baking</h2>
                <p> More recently, around the time I started university, I have taken an interest in baking. Baking has
                    given me a creative outlet which I have never experienced before. Additionally, it has given me a
                    keen attention to detail, it's been a great way to relax, it gives me something to bring to a
                    mountaineering society bake sale, and at the end of the day, who doesn't like cakes, pizza, bread or
                    biscuits? </p>
